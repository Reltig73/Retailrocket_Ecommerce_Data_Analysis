E-commerce Metrics Analysis

This project presents a detailed SQL-based analysis of key performance metrics for an e-commerce platform.
Using PostgreSQL and event-level data, it explores how user behavior impacts sales performance and retention over time.

Main Objectives

Measure and interpret Sales Conversion Rate — how effectively visits turn into transactions.

Calculate Returning Customer Rate — how many customers make repeat purchases.

Track Website Traffic and user engagement across different time periods.

Evaluate Add-to-Cart Rate and Cart Abandonment Rate as indicators of purchase intent.

Analyze Average Order Value (AOV) to understand spending patterns.

Estimate Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) to assess long-term growth.


Tools & Methods

PostgreSQL for data analysis and query optimization

Window functions, aggregations, and CTEs for metric computation

Timestamp-based grouping to track monthly performance trends


Key Insights

The analysis helps identify behavioral trends among visitors, the effectiveness of conversion funnels, and potential areas to improve retention and monetization.
